git diff --check = PASS
```

## Result

The v0.19 cancel executor adapter boundary is implemented as a local/offline
evidence command. It records that a future actual cancel command may only use a
matched V190-003 owner approval lifecycle and adapter capability declaration
for one order, one venue, one order-id type, and one attempt. It records
request, response, post-cancel readback, audit, and adapter failure taxonomy
contracts, and fail-closes missing CLI gates, unapproved owner lifecycle,
unsupported actual cancel capability, unsupported venue, unsupported order-id
type, bulk/cancel-all, retry, automatic cancel, multi-venue, and Dashboard
execution paths. This verification does not add a network cancel send,
production adapter integration, Dashboard operation controls, automatic or bulk
cancel, retry/replace/amend/flatten/remediation, credential persistence, or
production order submit lifecycle.

# V190-003 Verification

Date: 2026-06-27
Executor: Codex
Task: `V190-003` / GitHub issue `#579`

## Commands

```text
cargo fmt -p nautilus-cli = PASS
cargo test -p nautilus-cli owner_approval --lib = PASS, 8 tests
cargo test -p nautilus-cli parses_live_production_mutation_actual_cancel_owner_approval_lifecycle_options --lib = PASS, 1 test

git diff --check = PASS
```

## Result

The v0.19 owner approval execution lifecycle is implemented as a local/offline
evidence command. It authorizes one future actual cancel attempt only for a
matched, unexpired, unused owner-approved lifecycle bound to the V190-002 safety
contract, release manifest, cancel risk gate, order lineage, symbol, account
label, and venue. Missing, expired, reused, rejected, audited, release-mismatch,
order-mismatch, and missing-confirmation paths fail closed. This verification
does not add a cancel executor, adapter behavior change, network cancel
request, Dashboard approve/cancel control, automatic or bulk cancel, retry,
replace, amend, flatten, or production order submit lifecycle.

# V190-002 Verification

Date: 2026-06-27
Executor: Codex
Task: `V190-002` / GitHub issue `#578`

## Commands

```text
rg -n "single-shot|owner-approved|actual cancel|bulk|retry|Dashboard" docs crates scripts = PASS
rg -n "v0_19_0_actual_cancel_safety_contract|missing_owner_approval|owner_approval_reused|adapter_capability_missing|dashboard_operation_requested" README.md docs/rust-cutover/release docs/rust-cutover/evidence docs/versioning.md verification.md = PASS
git diff --check = PASS
scripts/ai/verify_fast.sh = PASS
```

## Result

The v0.19 actual cancel safety contract is documented and indexed. It binds any
future actual cancel path to one manual owner approval, one order, one venue,
one execution attempt, required owner-approval/risk-gate/order/release-manifest
and adapter-capability artifacts, and fail-closed behavior for missing, expired,
reused, stale, or mismatched evidence. This verification does not add a cancel
executor, adapter behavior change, runtime network request, production order
submit lifecycle, automatic or bulk cancel, retry/replace/amend/flatten, or
Dashboard operation controls.

# V190-001 Verification

Date: 2026-06-27
Executor: Codex
Task: `V190-001` / GitHub issue `#577`

## Commands

```text

NTPRO_RELEASE_GATE=1 scripts/ai/verify_release.sh release-surface-current-guard release-publication-guard = PASS

gh release view ntpro-rust-only-v0.18.1 --repo atxinbao/NTPRO = PASS
git diff --check = PASS
scripts/ai/verify_fast.sh = PASS
```

## Result

The v0.19 readiness gate is open for owner-approved single-shot actual cancel
design work only. The v0.18.1 blocker issues are closed, the v0.18.1 tag and
GitHub Release are published, hosted release gate run `28299860864` succeeded
with 50 jobs and 0 failures, and local strict provenance resolves the source to
commit `c395e71960255fefbf4100654fd53ce2bf33a08f`. This verification does not
add actual cancel send, adapter changes, runtime behavior changes, production
order submission, or Dashboard cancel controls.

# V181-007 Verification

Executor: Codex
Task: `V181-007` / GitHub issue `#576`

git diff --check = PASS
scripts/ai/verify_fast.sh = PASS
```

## Result

Dashboard cancel recovery diagnostics now degrade the v0.18 read-only panel for
missing artifacts, schema mismatches, source commit/tag provenance mismatches,
stale artifacts, true forbidden cancel flags, and true Dashboard cancel or
auto-approval controls. No actual cancel entrypoint, owner approval write
surface, network cancel endpoint, or adapter behavior was added.

# V181-006 Verification

Task: `V181-006` / GitHub issue `#575`

## Commands

```text

rg -n "release manifest|manifest|v0.18.1|actual_cancel" docs/rust-cutover/release scripts/ai = PASS
git diff --check = PASS
```

## Result

The v0.18.1 release manifest is machine-readable JSON and records the v0.18.0
baseline release, planned and actual patch tag fields, release gate list,
source/binary provenance handoff, capability boundary, and no-actual-cancel
flags. `verify_release_strict.sh v18` now reads this docs manifest, validates
its key fields, and embeds the manifest path/sha256 into the generated strict
binary provenance manifest.

# V181-005 Verification

```

## Result

Default `verify_fast.sh` is now documented and printed as fast smoke only. It
checks the pinned Rust toolchain and `cargo fmt --check` by default, and it is
not release validation or release evidence. v0.18/v0.18.1 release evidence
points to `verify_release.sh`; v0.18.1 strict provenance points to
`verify_release_strict.sh`.

```

## Result

The v0.18 strict provenance gate records and verifies the release binary path,
binary sha256, binary byte count, source commit, source tree, baseline release
tag, baseline release commit, cargo version, and rustc version. The v0.18.1
release-note draft lists `v18-strict-provenance` as required release evidence.

```

## Result

The default release guard path now validates `ntpro-rust-only-v0.18.0` for both
release surface and GitHub Release publication evidence. The v0.18.0 release
remains preview-only: no actual cancel send, no automatic remediation, no
Dashboard cancel controls, and no v0.18.1 release publication.

# V181-002 Verification

bash -n scripts/ai/check_release_surface_current.sh = PASS
scripts/ai/verify_fast.sh = PASS
git diff --check = PASS
```

## Result

The public release surface now presents `ntpro-rust-only-v0.18.0` as the
current formal baseline, `v0.18.1` as the release surface and provenance
hardening patch, and `v0.19.0` as the next owner-approved single-shot actual
cancel capability track. The v0.18.0 boundary remains preview-only: no actual
cancel send, no automatic remediation, and no Dashboard cancel controls.

## Result

The v0.18.0 release surface is closed out against the live GitHub Release and
hosted release gate. The release remains preview-only: no actual cancel send,
no automatic remediation, and no Dashboard cancel controls.

```

## Result

The V180-011 readiness report and release notes are locally verified. They
account for all V180 tasks and hosted smoke evidence while preserving the
no-send, no-automatic-remediation, no-Dashboard-cancel-control boundary and
stating that actual single-shot cancel remains v0.19+ scope.
