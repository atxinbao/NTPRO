# NTPRO

NTPRO is a Rust-only release workspace for a trading engine cutover from
NautilusTrader.

The current public milestone is:

```text
ntpro-rust-only-v0.1.0
```

This tag is the first Rust-only formal release source point after the RC3
validation path. It is published as the current GitHub Release:

```text
https://github.com/atxinbao/NTPRO/releases/tag/ntpro-rust-only-v0.1.0
```

## Current Status

NTPRO is now treated as a Rust-only product surface.

Supported product surfaces:

- Rust workspace crates.
- Rust CLI commands.
- Rust examples and documentation.
- Rust release verification scripts.
- Local Python helper scripts under `scripts/` only, used for repository
  control and release evidence.

Unsupported product surfaces:

- Python package installation.
- Python import/API usage.
- PyO3 bindings.
- Cython build or runtime paths.
- Python wheels, PyPI publication, or mixed Rust/Python packaging.
- Cap'n Proto serialization.

## Rust Toolchain

The release gate is validated with the pinned Rust toolchain:

```bash
rustup toolchain install 1.95.0
rustup override set 1.95.0
```

The repository can also be built through the local pinned toolchain path when
that is how the workspace is configured:

```bash
PATH="$HOME/.rustup/toolchains/1.95.0-aarch64-apple-darwin/bin:$PATH"
```

If Homebrew `rustc` or `cargo` appears before rustup on `PATH`, the local
verification scripts source `scripts/ai/toolchain_env.sh` to force Rust
`1.95.0` before running Cargo. See
`docs/rust-cutover/verification/toolchain.md`.

## User Entrypoint

Use the Rust CLI as the first product entrypoint:

```bash
cargo run -p nautilus-cli -- --help
cargo run -p nautilus-cli -- backtest --help
cargo run -p nautilus-cli -- sandbox --help
cargo run -p nautilus-cli -- live --help
```

The release verification gate checks that the CLI exposes the Rust product
commands without requiring Python.

## Install Path

NTPRO is source-build first. From a checked-out repository, run the CLI through
Cargo or install the binary locally:

```bash
cargo run -p nautilus-cli -- --help
cargo install --path crates/cli --bin nautilus --locked --force
nautilus --help
```

The current binary name is `nautilus`, provided by the `nautilus-cli` package.
NTPRO does not currently publish prebuilt binaries, Python wheels, PyPI
packages, or Docker images as product delivery paths.

## Verification

Fast local validation:

```bash
scripts/ai/verify_fast.sh
```

Full release validation:

```bash
scripts/ai/verify_release.sh
```

Rust-only surface checks:

```bash
scripts/ai/check_rust_only_runtime.sh
scripts/ai/check_cython_removed.sh
```

Golden trace validation:

```bash
scripts/ai/run_golden_traces.sh
REQUIRE_GOLDEN_REPLAY=1 scripts/ai/run_golden_traces.sh
```
