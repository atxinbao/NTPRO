# NTPRO

NTPRO is a Rust-only release workspace for a trading engine cutover from
NautilusTrader.

The current public milestone is:

```text
Current source tag: ntpro-rust-only-v0.6.0
Capability: Binance testnet dry-run runtime foundation
Active hardening track: v0.6.1 contract/dashboard/CI hardening
```

This tag is the current v0.6.0 source release point for the scoped Binance
testnet dry-run runtime foundation. It is published as a GitHub Release for the
tagged source tree:

```text
https://github.com/atxinbao/NTPRO/releases/tag/ntpro-rust-only-v0.6.0
```

## Current Status

NTPRO is now treated as a Rust-only product surface.

Supported product surfaces:

- Rust workspace crates.
- Rust CLI commands.
- Rust examples and documentation.
- Rust release verification scripts.
- Local Python helper scripts under `scripts/` only, used for repository
  control and release evidence.

Unsupported product surfaces:

- Python package installation.
- Python import/API usage.
- PyO3 bindings.
- Cython build or runtime paths.
- Python wheels, PyPI publication, or mixed Rust/Python packaging.
- Cap'n Proto serialization.

## Rust Toolchain

The release gate is validated with the pinned Rust toolchain:

```bash
rustup toolchain install 1.95.0
rustup override set 1.95.0
```

The repository can also be built through the local pinned toolchain path when
that is how the workspace is configured:

```bash
PATH="$HOME/.rustup/toolchains/1.95.0-aarch64-apple-darwin/bin:$PATH"
```

If Homebrew `rustc` or `cargo` appears before rustup on `PATH`, the local
verification scripts source `scripts/ai/toolchain_env.sh` to force Rust
`1.95.0` before running Cargo. See
`docs/rust-cutover/verification/toolchain.md`.

## User Entrypoint

Use the Rust CLI as the first product entrypoint:

```bash
cargo run -p nautilus-cli -- --help
cargo run -p nautilus-cli -- backtest --help
cargo run -p nautilus-cli -- sandbox --help
cargo run -p nautilus-cli -- live --help
```

The release verification gate checks that the CLI exposes the Rust product
commands without requiring Python.

## Install Path

NTPRO is source-build first. From a checked-out repository, run the CLI through
Cargo or install the binary locally:

```bash
cargo run -p nautilus-cli -- --help
cargo install --path crates/cli --bin nautilus --locked --force
nautilus --help
```

The current binary name is `nautilus`, provided by the `nautilus-cli` package.
NTPRO does not currently publish prebuilt binaries, Python wheels, PyPI
packages, or Docker images as product delivery paths.

## Current Capability Boundary

v0.6.0 is the current formal release line. It builds on two earlier internal
foundation layers:

- `v0.4.x`: Binance sandbox product foundation;
- `v0.5.0`: local Binance sandbox workflow artifacts;
- `v0.6.0`: Binance testnet dry-run runtime foundation.

`v0.5.0` was completed as a scoped readiness milestone and is absorbed into the
`v0.6.0` release tree. It is not published as a separate public GitHub Release.

`v0.6.1` is the active hardening track for the same published v0.6.0 release
surface. It aligns version wording, Dashboard copy, workflow artifact contracts,
offline-only probe semantics, and PR-stage smoke coverage. It does not expand
NTPRO into real Binance testnet connectivity.

The current release path supports:

- Rust CLI `workflow run --workflow binance-sandbox`;
- Rust CLI `workflow run --workflow binance-testnet --mode dry-run`;
- deterministic local artifact directories and manifest / summary / events
  contracts;
- checked-in testnet dry-run config;
- env-var-only credential policy artifact;
- offline connectivity probe artifact;
- dry-run order lifecycle artifact;
- artifact-only reconciliation artifact;
- Dashboard read-only workflow and testnet workflow surfaces.

The v0.3.0 local Supervisor control console and the v0.4.x Binance sandbox
foundation remain part of validated release history, but they are no longer the
current public milestone.

Not included in the v0.6.0 product claim:

- Live Binance testnet network connection.
- Real Binance testnet order submission.
- Real account reconciliation.
- Production Binance connectivity.
- Real account credential values in repository artifacts.
- Real funds.
- Production trading parity.
- Remote or multi-user Dashboard operation.
- Prebuilt binary or Docker release artifact delivery.

Also not included in the v0.6.1 hardening track:

- Any new live Binance testnet network capability.
- Any real Binance testnet order submission.
- Any production trading claim.
- Any Dashboard control that starts a network probe or reads credentials.

## Binance Testnet Dry-Run Boundary

The v0.6.0 product boundary is Binance testnet dry-run only. It is offline,
artifact-first, Rust-only, and explicitly non-production.

This release does not connect to Binance, does not store or load real API key
values, does not submit real orders, and does not claim live or production
trading readiness.

The scope and readiness documents are:

- `docs/rust-cutover/release/v0_5_0_workflow_artifacts_readiness_report.md`
- `docs/rust-cutover/release/v0_6_0_binance_testnet_dry_run_readiness_report.md`
- `docs/versioning.md`

## Verification

Fast local validation:

```bash
scripts/ai/verify_fast.sh
```

`verify_fast.sh` is a fast smoke only: it checks the pinned Rust toolchain and
`cargo fmt --check` by default. It does not run workspace `cargo check`,
clippy, golden traces, or release validation unless optional flags or stronger
scripts are used.

Full release validation:

```bash
scripts/ai/verify_release.sh
```

Rust-only surface checks:

```bash
scripts/ai/check_rust_only_runtime.sh
scripts/ai/check_cython_removed.sh
```

Golden trace validation:

```bash
scripts/ai/run_golden_traces.sh
REQUIRE_GOLDEN_REPLAY=1 scripts/ai/run_golden_traces.sh
```

## Release Notes

`ntpro-rust-only-v0.6.0` is the current Rust-only source release for the
Binance testnet dry-run runtime foundation line. `v0.5.0` remains a completed
internal workflow-artifact milestone absorbed into `v0.6.0`, `v0.4.1` remains
the latest Binance sandbox public patch baseline, `v0.3.0` remains the Local
Supervisor Control Console baseline, `v0.2.0` remains the local multi-node
runtime foundation baseline, and `v0.1.0` remains the first formal Rust-only
cutover release and historical baseline.

Before cutting the next release, review:

- current GitHub checks for the tagged commit;
- release notes;
- public README surface;
- Rust CLI help output;
- repository language display.
